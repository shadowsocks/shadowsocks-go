# shadowsocks-go

Current version: 0.6 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go.png)](https://travis-ci.org/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go)

shadowsocks-go is a lightweight tunnel proxy which can help you get through firewalls. It is a port of [shadowsocks](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks).

The protocol is compatible with the origin shadowsocks (if both have been upgraded to the latest version).

# Install

Compiled client binaries are provided on [google code](http://code.google.com/p/shadowsocks-go/downloads/list). (Compiled with cgo disabled.)

You can also install from source (assume you have go installed):

```
# on server
go get github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/cmd/shadowsocks-server
# on client
go get github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/cmd/shadowsocks-local
```

It's recommend to disable cgo when compiling shadowsocks-go. This will prevent the go runtime from creating too many threads for dns lookup.

# Usage

Both the server and client program will look for `config.json` in the current directory. You can use `-c` option to specify another configuration file.

Configuration file is in json format and has the same syntax with [shadowsocks-nodejs](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks-nodejs/). You can download the sample [`config.json`](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/blob/master/config.json), change the following values:

```
server          your server ip or hostname
server_port     server port
local_port      local socks5 proxy port
method          encryption method, null by default, or use "rc4"
password        a password used to encrypt transfer
timeout         server option, in seconds
```

Run `shadowsocks-server` on your server. To run it in the background, run `shadowsocks-server > log &`.

On client, run `shadowsocks-local`. Change proxy settings of your browser to

```
SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:local_port
```

## Command line options

Command line options can override settings from configuration files. Use `-h` option to see all available options.

```
shadowsocks-local -s server_name -p server_port -l local_port -k password -m rc4 -c config.json
shadowsocks-server -p server_port -k password -t timeout -m rc4 -c config.json
```

Use `-d` option to enable debug message.


## Use multiple servers on client

```
server_password    specify multiple server and password, server should be in the form of host:port
```

Here's a sample configuration [`client-multi-server.json`](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/blob/master/sample-config/client-multi-server.json). Given `server_password`, client program will ignore `server_port`, `server` and `password` options.

Servers are chosen in round robin fasion. If a server can't be connected, the client will try the next one. The client does not try to detect connection problems caused by incorrect password, this is intended for the user to notice the error.

## Multiple users with different passwords on server

The server can support users with different passwords. Each user will be served by a unique port. Use the following options on the server for such setup:

```
port_password   specify multiple ports and passwords to support multiple users
```

Here's a sample configuration [`server-multi-port.json`](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/blob/master/sample-config/server-multi-port.json). Given `port_password`, server program will ignore `server_port` and `password` options.

### Update port password for a running server

Edit the config file used to start the server, then send `SIGHUP` to the server process.

# Note to OpenVZ users

**Use OpenVZ VM that supports vswap**. Otherwise, the OS will incorrectly account much more memory than actually used. shadowsocks-go on OpenVZ VM with vswap takes about 3MB memory after startup. (Refer to [this issue](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/issues/3) for more details.)

If vswap is not an option and memory usage is a problem for you, try [shadowsocks-libuv](https://github.com/dndx/shadowsocks-libuv).
